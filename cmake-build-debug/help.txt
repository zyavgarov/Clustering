This is the list of supported commands
BUFFER {string operation}
    Doing operations over the cloud
    operation = "unload"
        Unloads buffer to field
    operation = "add": {int id}
        Adds cloud with id to buffer
    operation = "rotate": {double angle}
        Rotates buffer to angle
    operation = "shift": {double x} {double y}
        Shifts buffer to vector (x, y)
    operation = "zoom": {double k}
        Zooms buffer to coefficient k from its center
    operation = "mirror"
        Reflects the cloud like in mirror
    operation = "erase"
        Deletes all points from the buffer
DBSCAN {int id} {int k}
        Searches clusters in the field using dbscan algorithm with parameter k using incidences in search numbered id
GC {double cx} {double cy} {double dx} {double dy} {int len}
	Generates cloud on the field. Center of the cloud is cx cy, dispersion of the cloud is dx and dy by x and y.
	The number of points in the cloud is len

MATRIX
    Sets field to state readonly and prepares it to be analyzed
WAVE {int id}
    Searches clusters in the field using wave-clustering algorithm using incidences in search numbered id
