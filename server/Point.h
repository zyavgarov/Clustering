/*
 * While using Point you need to know
 * - anywhere you can count current number of points using Point::quantity()
 * - the only way to make a new point on Field is to set id = -1 (by default constructor or manually)
 *   other way will lead you to loose point in Point::quantity and get_point_by_id
 * - If the point has id 0 it is service point.
 *   It is not counted on the field, can't be clustered and so on, but can be useful in your own operations
 * - You have arithmetical operators such as + Point, * double, /double. I hope their usage is obvious
